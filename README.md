## Chinook Laravel System 

This system is not a production ready. This was developed to test building a system based on the Chinook Database

### Chinook Database

The Chinook Database is a database developed for testing and learning, to superceed the Northwind database. I have modified the Chinook database to follow Laravel's naming conventions.

Run the following to deploy the chinook database: 

`php artisan chinook:execute-sql`
